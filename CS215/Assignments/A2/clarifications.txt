In Q4E, the Xi are iid Bernoulli random variables. It is true that the result holds in general, as can be shown by Chebyshev; however, we only require a proof via Chernoff of the Bernoulli case.

Also, in P4B, Chebyshev-Cantelli, there is no modulus. You just need to establish 
P[X - mu ≥ t] ≤ s²/(s² + t²).
s = \sigma, t = \tau.


More clarifications following doubts asked, and a few other pointers about A2. Please read till the end.

(Clarifications)
- Q3D, subtask 3: plot the "binomial distribution Bin(k*, \theta*)" -> plot the "Gamma distribution Gamma(k*, \theta*)". I suppose that was clear, but pointing it out for completeness. Also, please read subpart 3 carefully, there is a nuance in calling the gamma.pdf funcion; don't call it spicy.stats.gamma.pdf incorrectly!
- Q3C,D,F: fsolve requires initial values, whose choice may determine which solution it converges to. As long as you choose initial parameters roughly near what you believe would be close to a good solution, any solution it converges to is alright. Try different choices and see what maximizes likelihood.
- Q2C: only the second subfigure in Figure 1 of a2.pdf is to be reproduced.
- Q4B: In Chebyshev-Cantelli, there is no modulus. You just need to establish that P[X - μ ≥ τ] ≤ σ²/(σ² + τ²).
- Q4E: the X_i are iid Bernoulli random variables, since Chernoff was proved only for the case.
- Questions 1, 4, and 5 have no code necessary.

Q2E (bonus), subpart 2 has a typo. The correct probability P_h[X = 2i] is 1/√(pi k) exp(- i²/k). Essentially, h in the problem statement is replaced everywhere by k = h/2.
