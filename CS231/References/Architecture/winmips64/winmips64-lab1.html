Lab, Lab 07</font></h1>
<h3 class="western"><font color="#0000ff">Goals</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Learn to use
	the WinMIPS64 pipeline simulator for the MIPS64 architecture</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Understanding
	various kinds of hazards and stalls</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Understanding
	data forwarding</p>
</ol>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Instructions</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li><p>These exercises are to be done individually.</p>
	<li><p>While you are encouraged to discuss with your colleagues, do
	not cross the fine line between discussion <i>to understand</i>
	versus discussion as a <i>short-cut</i> to complete your lab without
	really understanding.</p>
	<li><p>Create a directory called &lt;rollno&gt;-&lt;labno&gt;. Store
	all relevant files to this lab in that directory.</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>In the exercises, you will be asked various questions. Note
		down the answers to these in a file called “answers.txt”.</p>
		<li><p>In some parts of the exercises, you will have to show a demo
		to a TA; these are marked as such. The evaluation for each lab will
		be in the subsequent lab, or during a time-slot agreed upon with
		the TAs. For this evaluation, you need to upload your code as well.</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>Before leaving the lab, ensure the following:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>You have marked attendance on SAFE</p>
		<li><p>You have uploaded your submission on BodhiTree, and
		downloaded and checked if the submissions is right</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>Things to ensure during TA evaluation of a particular lab
	submission:</p>
	<ol type="a">
		<li><p>The TA has looked at your text file with the answers to
		various questions</p>
		<li><p>The TA has given you marks out of 10, and has entered it in
		the marks sheet</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>You have to use the MIPS conventions, unless mentioned
	otherwise.</p>
</ol>
<h3 class="western" style="page-break-after: avoid"><font color="#0000ff">Using
the WinMIPS64 simulator</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The
	WinMIPS64 simulator is a MIPS64 pipeline simulator. The MIPS64
	architecture is the 64-bit version of the MIPS architecture. The
	MIPS64 5-stage pipeline is similar to the MIPS/DLX 5-stage pipeline.
	The MIPS64 instruction set reference is given to you, please refer
	to it to write MIPS64 assembly code.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">winmips64 is
	a windows program, but it can run on Linux using “wine
	/path/to/winmips64.exe”, on the lab machines; “wine” is
	windows emulator. Refer to the winmips64 tutorial for a brief
	introduction to winmips64.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">The
	winmips64 simulator uses a simple “memory-mapped I/O” scheme for
	input/output, in case you need it. You can look at the testio.s to
	understand. Such I/O should not be required for the exercises in
	this lab, but you may need it to understand pre-written code (e.g.
	if you try to step through factorial.s).</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Demo to
	TA [1 mark]:</b> load and run the “factorial.s” program.
	Remember, you will find that at some point it is asking for terminal
	input, so be sure to open the “terminal” sub-window in
	winmips64.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Question
	[0.5 marks]:</b> What branch prediction technique does the simulator
	use? Substantiate your answer. You can use any program other than
	factorial.s for this, if convenient.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Question
	[0.5 marks]:</b> In which stage does the branch instruction require
	its inputs? Substantiate your answer.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western" style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; page-break-after: avoid">
<font color="#0000ff">Identifying data forwarding, stalls</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">You can now
	use simpler DLX code, like the one in “winmips64-lab.s”. In most
	of these cases, you have to show the corresponding cycle diagram (in
	the “clock cycle diagram” window in winmips64).</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">In the
	“pipeline” diagram (in one of the WinDLX windows), you can see
	that apart from the EX, there are three other functional units:
	multiplier, FP adder, DIV.</p>
</ul>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Write DLX
	assembly code which causes (a) one or more data stalls, and (b) one
	or more control stalls.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Add to the
	above code such that there is now a stall in the ID stage of a
	branch instruction.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Add to the
	above code such that there is data forwarding from the EX stage to
	the ID stage for some pair of instructions.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Add to the
	above code such that there is data forwarding from the MEM stage to
	the ID stage for some pair of instructions.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Add to the
	above code to cause the maximum possible stall between a pair of
	instructions.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Add to the
	above code to cause data forwarding between two instructions that
	are as far apart as possible.</p>
	<li><p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal">Add to the
	above code to cause a WAW stall.</p>
	<li><p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Add
	to the above code to cause a structural stall.</span></span></p>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Demo
to TA [1 x 8 = 8 marks]:</b></span></span> <span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Show
all the above code and show the “clock cycle diagram” and
indicate the above mentioned features. Also show the “statistics”
window.</span></span></p>
